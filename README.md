# Trashteroids
Unity Asteroids game made for Fall 2017 EGaDs Game Jam where the theme was "Trash"

You control a spaceship that defends the earth form asteroids made of trash by shooting them before they hit.
WASD for movement.
Aim and shoot with mouse.
Shooting asteroids breaks them into two smaller asteroids, until they disappear.
The ship has an energy supply which depletes when far from Earth or when ramming asteroids and replenishes when near Earth.

The goal is to defend Earth for as long as possible.
